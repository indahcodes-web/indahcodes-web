### Hello, world! I'm a newbie programmer 👨‍💻

I am an undergraduate Information System student with a huge passion for turning ideas into reality through code. My journey in web development started with a simple "Hello, World!" and now I'm excited to build more complex and useful web applications.

💻 **What I'm currently learning and using:**
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MySQL, MongoDB
- **Tools:** Git, VS Code, Figma
